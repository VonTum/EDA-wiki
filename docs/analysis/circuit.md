### Circuit Analysis
 - [Qucs: Quite Universal Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/Qucs/qucs/), under GNU General Public License v2.0
   - Setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
 - [ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/)
   - Open source spice simulator.
 - [gnucap](http://gnucap.org/)
   - The GNU circuit analysis package.
 - [SPICE](http://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/) (Berkeley)
   - A general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear dc, nonlinear transient, and linear ac analyses.
 - [CKTSO](https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso) (ICT)
   - CKTSO is a high-performance parallel sparse direct solver specially designed for SPICE-based circuit simulation.
 - [CKTSO-GPU](https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso-gpu) (ICT)
   - CKTSO-GPU is a GPU acceleration module of CKTSO, a high-performance parallel sparse direct solver specially designed for SPICE-based circuit simulation.
 - [NICSLU](https://github.com/chenxm1986/nicslu) (Tsinghua)
   - Parallel sparse direct solver for circuit simulation.
 - [mixedsim](https://github.com/Isotel/mixedsim) (Isotel)
   - Mixed signal simulation with Verilog.
 - [Gnucap: GNU Circuit Analysis Package](http://gnucap.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gnucap:start)
   - A modern "post-spice" analog and mixed signal circuit simulator.
 - [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) (Sandia NL)
   - An open source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale parallel computing platforms.

### Interface
- [CDF](https://github.com/paripath/cdf) (Paripath)
  - CDF or characterization description format is effective in capturing properties of VLSI cells and IPS at several levels of abstraction.
  - It is a baseline proposal for a standard to act as an interface across VLSI software(s) using and/or interfacting with SPICE simulators.
