### Process Design Kit (PDK)
+ [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk) (Google, SkyWater)
  - The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.
+ [Libre Silicon](https://libresilicon.com/)
  - We develop a free (as in freedom, not as in free of charge) and open source semiconductor manufacturing process standard, including a full mixed signal PDK, and provide a quick, easy and inexpensive way for manufacturing.
+ [ASAP7](http://asap.asu.edu/asap/) (Arizona State, ARM), "available for non-commercial academic use for free"
  - The PDK contains SPICE-compatible FinFET device models (BSIM-CMG), Technology files for Cadence Virtuoso, Design Rule Checker (DRC), Layout vs Schematic Checker (LVS) and Extraction Deck for the 7nm technology node.

### PDK for CNTFET
- Variation-Aware [Nanosystem Design Kit (NDK)](https://nanohub.org/resources/22582) (Stanford)
  - A framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.

### PDK for Silicon Photonics
- [SiEPIC EBeam PDK](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) (UBC), under [MIT License](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
  - For silicon photonics layout, design, verification and circuit simulation.
